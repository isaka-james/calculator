<img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=reprogamaco&label=Profile%20views&color=0e75b6&style=flat" alt="Profile Views" />
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the <b>jQuery Calculator</b> project! This simple yet powerful calculator allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations and even solve complex mathematical equations involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. The calculator also handles infinite results gracefully, displaying "Infinity" where applicable.

## Project Overview

- **Calculator Type:** jQuery Calculator
- **API Integration:** Yes, the calculator utilizes an external API to fetch answers for certain calculations.
- **Development Time:** 2 hours
- **Access the Calculator:** [jQuery Calculator](https://reprogamaco.github.io/calculator)

## ⚠️ UPDATE
- I disabled the tracking analysis which is now [opensource](https://github.com/reprogamaco/backend-tracker-for-calculator).
- It is  working on **firefox** browser, other browsers not guarenteed to work!.
- To fetch results(**calculator answers**) takes like 5 seconds, hope to improve later.
- When you click **REACTIVATE SUBMISSION**, you will go directly to the calculator without filling informations, this works only if you filled the informations before!.


## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations:** Perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease.
- **Exponentiation:** Calculate exponential values by using the caret (^) symbol.
- **Infinite Results:** When a result is infinite (e.g., division by zero), the calculator displays "Infinity" to provide clear feedback.
- **API Integration:** The calculator leverages an external API to fetch answers for specific calculations, enhancing its functionality.
- **Future Improvements:** The calculator's speed is affected by the current API provider, resulting in slightly slower performance. The developer is actively exploring options to build their own API for improved speed and efficiency.
